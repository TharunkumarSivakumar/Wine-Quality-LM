# Wine-Quality-LM
Wine Quality Learning Model
Developed a machine learning model to predict the quality of wines by analyzing various properties. The project utilized the Wine Quality dataset. Key tasks included data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature selection, model training, and performance evaluation.

Key Responsibilities:
Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and prepared the dataset for analysis by handling missing values and normalizing features.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Employed data visualization techniques to identify trends and relationships among features.

Feature Selection: Used ExtraTreesClassifier to determine the importance of each feature in predicting wine quality.

Model Development: Implemented a Logistic Regression model and fine-tuned its hyperparameters to optimize performance.

Model Evaluation: Assessed the model's accuracy and other performance metrics using confusion matrices and accuracy scores.

Visualization: Created visualizations to communicate findings, including feature importance plots, correlation heatmaps, and distribution plots.

Tools & Technologies: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn.

Outcome:
Achieved a prediction model with adequate accuracy. The project demonstrated proficiency in data science workflows and the ability to leverage machine learning techniques for practical applications.
